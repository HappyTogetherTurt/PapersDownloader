Simply download the entire folder except the 'src' folder (unless you want to try make your own builds, in which case go ahead) and run the EXE (should have a Shrek icon, but it may not)

IMPORTANT:
	You NEED 2019 Microsoft Visual C++ runtimes to run this. You likely already have them, but if not click on this link to download them from an official Microsoft source:
	https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x64.exe (for x64 - if in doubt, use this one)
	https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x86.exe (for x86 - if youre on 32 bit, this is likely you)
	https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/VC_redist.arm64.exe (for ARM64 - honestly no idea what uses ARM cores for Windows, a Surface Pro/tablet maybe?)
